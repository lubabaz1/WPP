Work Productivity Predictor of Working Parents


To measure professional efficiency is not an easy task for the HR team let alone a company. 
There are many factors which directly or indirectly contribute an employeeâ€™s work 
productivity being increased or decreased. Productivity at work also leads to employee 
retention & satisfaction. The human resource pool comprising of working parents can be a 
great segment to analyze work productivity. My main aim in this project is to predict 
productivity of working parents in corporate sectors based on some features from a 
qualitative research in telecommunication & banking industries in Bangladesh. Moreover, 
this project finds out the significant factors behind the increased work productivity- in 
which the highest accuracy is achieved by using Supervised Machine Learning techniques.
